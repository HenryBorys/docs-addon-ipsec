<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This guide describes the [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) IPsec add-on. The topics included in this guide include installation and configuration, troubleshooting, and credential rotation. Your organization may require IPsec if you transmit sensitive data.

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

The IPsec add-on for PCF provides security to the network layer of the OSI model with a [strongSwan](https://www.strongswan.org/) implementation of IPsec. The IPsec add-on provides a strongSwan job to each BOSH-deployed virtual machine (VM).

IPsec encrypts IP data flow between hosts, between security gateways, and between security gateways and hosts. The PCF IPsec add-on secures network traffic within a Cloud Foundry deployment and provides internal system protection if a malicious actor breaches your firewall.
