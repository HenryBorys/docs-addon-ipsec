This guide describes the IPsec Add-on for PCF, which secures data transmissions inside [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF). Topics covered in this guide include IPsec Add-on for PCF installation and configuration, troubleshooting, and credential rotation.

Your organization may require IPsec if you transmit sensitive data.

## Overview ##

The IPsec Add-on for PCF provides security to the network layer of the OSI model with a [strongSwan](https://www.strongswan.org/) implementation of IPsec. The IPsec Add-on provides a strongSwan job to each BOSH-deployed virtual machine (VM).

IPsec encrypts IP data flow between hosts, between security gateways, and between security gateways and hosts. The IPsec Add-on for PCF secures network traffic within a Cloud Foundry deployment and provides internal system protection if a malicious actor breaches your firewall.

## IPsec Implementation Details ##
