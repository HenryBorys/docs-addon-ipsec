<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes the process Pivotal recommends to renew expired certificates used in the IPsec manifest.

To renew certificates after they have expired follow the steps below:

1. Retrieve the latest runtime config by running the following command:
  <pre>
    bosh runtime-config > PATH-TO-RUNTIME-CONFIG
  </pre>

2. Generate a new set of certificates. 
   For development or test environments, you can use self-signed certificates. 
   For information about self-signed certificates, see [Generate a Self-Signed Certificate](./installing.html#self-signed).

3. Update the various certificate fields in the runtime `config.yml` file saved 
   from step 1 with a new set of certificates. 
   See the field descriptions under [Add Linux VM Support to Your Manifest](./installing.html#linux) 
   for more information about these fields.

4. Change the release version.
  <pre>
releases:
\- {name: ipsec, version: NEW\_VERSION}
  </pre>


5. Update the runtime config by running the following command:
  <pre>
    bosh update runtime-config PATH-TO-SAVE-THE-RUNTIME-CONFIG
  </pre>

6. Navigate to your **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager.
7. Click **Apply Changes**.
